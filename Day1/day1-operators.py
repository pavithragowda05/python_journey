#operators : operators define what activity to be perfromed with given
#set of data.

#mathematical operators :
# +(addition)
# -(subsraction)
# *(multiplication)
#/(division ,gives quotient)
# % (mod, division, gives reminder)
# ** (power/expoent)
# // (floor division,in removes decimal part shows integer part only)

#relational operators :
# < : less than
# > : greater than
# <= : less than or equal to
# >= : greater than or equal to
# != : not equal
# == : idential/equality
    
#logial operator :
# and : conjunction
# or  : disjunction
# not : negation
    
#assignment operator :
# = : assign
# += : add and assing
# -= : sub and assign
# /= : divide and assing
# *= : multiply and assing
# //=:floor divsion and assing

#mathematical operators :
x=100
y=50
a = x+y
b = x-y
c = x/y
d = x%y
e = x**2
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(d)
print(e)

#//floor division : gives quoitient which rounded to nearest
#smallest
i=10
j=6
k = i/j
print(k)
l = i//j
print(l)
